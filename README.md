# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is Richard, and I'm currently a web developer working primarily with React and NodeJS, working on full stack projects. I am, however, doing a bit of robotics with arduinos and Raspberry Pi's and am trying to get better at it.

## About Me: ðŸ˜ƒ 

- One of my favorite parts of programming is cryptography and security. I enjoy the challenge that it provides and the mathematical invincibility towards attacks.
- I enjoy playing tennis a lot and it's the primary sport that I do

## Projects: ðŸš§ 

Currently none, but I'll post the links to them here once there are some.

## Contact Information: ðŸ“§
